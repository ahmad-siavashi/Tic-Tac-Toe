## Project Overview

Welcome to the Tic Tac Toe Game in Assembly repository! This project was initiated on December 14, 2012, and is an Intel x86 assembly language implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game. It was developed using the TASM assembler by a team of two dedicated programmers. This text-based game offers various modes of play, including Player vs. Player, Player vs. Computer, and even Computer vs. Computer.

## Game Modes

### Player Vs. Player

In this mode, two human players can take turns playing Tic Tac Toe on the same computer. Simply take your turns using the keyboard or mouse to select your moves.

### Player Vs. Computer

Challenge your wits against the computer! This mode allows you to play against an AI opponent. Can you outsmart the computer and win the game?

### Computer Vs. Computer

Sit back and watch as two computer players battle it out. This mode is perfect for those who want to see how AI algorithms fare against each other.

## Features

- **Fully Textual Interface:** The game provides a text-based interface for a classic gaming experience. No fancy graphics, just pure gameplay.

- **Keyboard Availability:** Control the game using your keyboard for quick and precise moves. Use the arrow keys and other keybindings to make your selections.

- **Mouse Availability:** If you prefer a mouse, don't worry! The game supports mouse input, making it easy to click your way through the game board.
